Over the last couple of weeks, I have been working with the rudder foil subteam to finalize the rudder foil and skeg design.  In order to verify our design, we have decided to use UBC's Parkinson Wind Tunnel to test our design. We are going to find our drag and life coefficents, our Reynold's number for each of our rudder foil and skeg designs and flow visualizations. 

I am going to recieve training to use the Parkinson's Wind Tunnel at [UBC's Areolab](http://mech.ubc.ca/aerolab/facilities/) this Thursday.

Throughout Summer 2018, I volunteered with Tetra Society as an engineering designer. I worked with A. to create a new adaptive device because his old one kept falling out of his hand and he would not be able to to use his telephone or the television.

**Client Consultation**
I met with A. to discuss commerical and customized options for his new adaptive device.  There are no commercial options for A. so he contacted Tetra Soceity.  We discussed the needs and requirements for his new device.  The needs and requirements for the device are summarized in the following table.  

|**Needs**          | **Requirements**                         |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Minimize dropping | Has a strap to fit around A.'s hand      |
| Fits in hand      | 3D modeled to conform to A.'s hand shape |
| Easy to hold      | Lightweight (less than 200 grams)        |
| Comfortable       | Made with body safe, flexible plastic    |

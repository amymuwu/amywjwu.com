Throughout Summer 2018, I volunteered with Tetra Society as an engineering designer. I worked with A. to create a new adaptive device because his old one kept falling out of his hand and he would not be able to to use his telephone or the television.

**Client Consultation**
I met with A. to discuss commerical and customized options for his new adaptive device.  There are no commercial options for A. so he contacted Tetra Soceity.  We discussed the needs and requirements for his new device.  The needs and requirements for the device are summarized in the following table.  

|**Needs**          | **Requirements**                         |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Minimize dropping | Has a strap to fit around A.'s hand      |
| Fits in hand      | 3D modeled to conform to A.'s hand shape |
| Easy to hold      | Lightweight (less than 200 grams)        |
| Comfortable       | Made with body safe, flexible plastic    |

**Materials** 
I choose the following materials for being durable, comfortable and body safe.
- elastic hand strap (polyster and cotton composite with velcro openings) - $1.00
- Hand "cover" (3D Printed TPE) - $1.25
- "Rod" (PLA) - $0.50

For the hand "cover" TPE was choosen over other "soft" plastics because TPE is often choosen for medical devices and has much higher ability to retain it's shape.  Total cost: **$2.75**

**CAD and 3D Printing**
I took a few pictures of A.'s hands and pulled them up to "sculpt" out the shape in solidworks so it fits in his hand perfectly.  At that time, my printer was incapable of 3D printing soft materials so my co-worker helped me print it using his Prusa MK2 at 0.2 mm layer height.

Image 1: His last assistive device (right of image) was made from (heavy) splinting material and wrapped with electrical tape.

**Iteratations**
Version 1 was not successfully adapted because A. could not reach the "off" button of his television remote.  To fix this, I added a slight incline of 20 degrees to the pointer section of the device.
